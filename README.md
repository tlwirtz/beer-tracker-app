# beer-tracker-app

## Purpose
A simple web client for tracking my personal beer inventory.
It is powered on the back-end by the [beer-tracker-api](https://github.com/tlwirtz/beer-tracker-api).

The client is built using React and Redux and is deployed using [now](https://zeit.co/now/).
A deployed version can be found at: [https://build-sxtppvtknp.now.sh](https://build-sxtppvtknp.now.sh)

## Future Roadmap

1. Add support for IoT Devices exposed by the [beer-tracker-api](https://github.com/tlwirtz/beer-tracker-api).
1. A nice splash screen on the main route.
1. Authentication (Firebase? / Auth0?).
1. Simple analytics on main screen.
