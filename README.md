# beer-tracker-app

## MVP
 * As a user I want to see a list of beers in my database so that I know what I'm tracking
 * As a user I want to see the current inventory levels for each beer, so I know what I have
 * As a user I want to be able to add or subtract inventory so that I know how much beer I have
 * As a user I want to see a list of transactions so I can audit who and when inventory was adjusted
 * As a user I want to add or remove beers so that I can expand my selection of drinks.
 * As a dev I want to use Redux so the current state of my application is easily reasoned about
 * As a dev I want to use React so that my UI is built out of easily reusable pieces.
